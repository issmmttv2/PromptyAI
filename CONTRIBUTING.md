## Development Setup

### Backend Development

```bash
cd codes/backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd codes/frontend/promptyai-frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Python)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Add comments for complex logic

```python
def enhance_prompt(text: str, style: str) -> str:
    """
    Enhance a prompt using AI.
    
    Args:
        text: The original prompt text
        style: The writing style to apply
        
    Returns:
        The enhanced prompt text
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Frontend (JavaScript/React)

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic

```javascript
/**
 * Generate an enhanced prompt
 * @param {string} prompt - The original prompt
 * @param {string} style - The writing style
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} The enhanced prompt data
 */
async function generatePrompt(prompt, style) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

Examples:
```
Add sentiment analysis to prompt generation
Fix MongoDB connection timeout issue
Update README with Docker instructions
```
